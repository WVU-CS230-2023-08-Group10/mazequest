# MazeQuest
MazeQuest is a website that contains the two-dimensional dungeon crawler RPG, MazeQuest, of which is entirely played in the browser. 

## Motivation
MazeQuest was built as a group project for an Introductory Software Engineering course, where the team was tasked with building a website to offer a service. Our group decided to create a video game that can be played within the website itself: Our decision to build a game stemmed from our shared interest in video games and was motivated by our interest in learning more about how video games are made. Having little to no experience with building websites and video games, the team took this project as a means to challenge ourselves and build a unique video game that we *would* want to play ourselves. Part of what we felt would make or break our game was the ability for users to design their own levels. We wanted to create the tools that allowed each user to create new places & environments for their game, all in the browser. Here's what came of it all: Welcome to Mazequest.

## Getting Started
MazeQuest is competely contained within the website itself and does not require any downloads or installations to be able to use. In order to use the Level Builder and access to the game itself, users must create a new account or login with an existing, authenticated account. The website can be found [here](https://dev.d1nqqr84hhhv1o.amplifyapp.com/).

### Navigating the Website
##### The website is divided into 8 tabs that contains different information and functionalities of the website. 
* "Home" is where the game synopsis and controls can be found. 
* "Sign Up" is where a user can create a new account. "Login" is where user's can login to an existing account. 
* "LevelBuilder" is the tab that houses are level creator tools. User's can create their own levels using the tools provided, give their level a name, and save them to be used later.
* "Game Window is where the MazeQuest game lives. The game is displayed in a canvas where you player can be controlled.
* "Stats" contains game statistics about top players of the game and the user currently signed in. The top table displays information from players who have some of the highest statistics in the game. The bottom table contains statistics about the personal user who is currently signed in.
* "Settings" is where users can change the volume of or mute the website's music if they'd like.
* "Account" is where users can change their password or logout of the website.
